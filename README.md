# Monkey Bot v0

This Bot was created mainly from the tutorial series created by [The Coding Train](https://youtu.be/7A-bnPlxj4k) and uses some copyright free images gathered from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). 

## What's the point?

Good Question, this is a pretty poor bot - it doens't do all that much at the moment. It was mainly created so that I could get some experience working with discord bots, but maybe in the future I will add more functionality that will make it a bit more interesting.

## How do I add this bot to my server?
[Follow this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=800851910550093854&scope=bot) to add the bot to your server. It currently isn't hosted anywhere so you're at my will in regards to whether the bot is up or not.

If you do want to host this yourself you'll need to edit the envExample.txt file and replace enter your own discord API bot key and TENOR key and save the envExample file as '.env'
